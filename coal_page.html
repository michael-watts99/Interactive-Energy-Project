                        Environment:
                    
                        <p>
                            Coal is burnt to make the electricity for everything!
                            But there's a problem, it pollutes our air we breathe, every time we burn more coal,
                            smoke from that gets released into the air, that is not good.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            What's worse is that there's no way for us to make coal clean,
                            it will always pollute when being burnt. Even when we catch the smoke it still gets out into the environment!

                        </p>
                        <p class="final_para">
                            When the smoke from burning all this coal stays in the air, it will make the Earth warmer, which would be a disaster.
                            <br>
                            It will be so bad that soon the ice in Antarctica will start melting!
                            <br>
                            This is because the Earth can't handle the Carbon Dioxide found in the smoke from Coal, it is simply too much for the trees to absorb.

                    <body>
                        <p>
                            Coal power stations are becoming unreliable because they are so old.
                            <br>
                            When they break, we lose electricity, meaning this computer won't work!
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most coal power stations in Australia will all be over 40 years old by the year 2030, this means that they are making enough electricity for 40 years ago, but now now.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When the weather gets really bad the power stations will struggle, this could be extreme heat, extreme cold, or rain.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Over the first 6 months of 2018 more than 100 power stations have failed, this means more than 100 times people temporarily lost electricity. With so many failing over the 6 months, that's 2 - 3 stations per day!
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It costs a lot of money to continue running the coal power stations. Once they're over 40 years old the cost just to maintain them is huge.
                            <br>
                            Building new coal power staions is even more expensive.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cost of building new coal power plants is huge when compared with the cost of building new solar power plants which will survive into the future.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The cost of solar plants will also continue to fall well into the future while the cost of coal will only continue to rise.
